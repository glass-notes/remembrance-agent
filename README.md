# remembrance-agent
Java package for Remembrance Agents! Based on Rhodes/Starner

## Commands

### Building

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

### Installing as Launch Daemon (macOS)

```bash
sudo bash ./bin/install
```

Now you can run `ra-desktop` from any where. Use the flag `--use-cache` to save on redundant calls to time-expensive data stores like Google Drive.
